# Parkuzzle
A parkour/puzzle minecraft map with action mixed within!

How to play:

1. Create a FREE Aternos Server
2. Upload the ZIP Archive to Worlds 
3. Software --> Spigot/Bukkit
4. Plugins --> Download WorldGuard, World Edit, and ChunkLoaderv.1.0.9
5. Paste CHUNKPASTE in the config for Chunkloader and paste GUARDPASTE in the config for WorldGuard

Sorry you have to do all this, it is a bit finnicky with Aternos.

# Parkuzzle
A two-player parkour/puzzle minecraft map with action mixed within! (1.19.1)

How to play:

1. Create a FREE Aternos Server
2. Make the server 1.19.1 (Server --> Version)
3. Upload the ZIP Archive to Worlds 
4. Software --> Spigot/Bukkit
5. Plugins --> Download WorldGuard, World Edit, and ChunkLoaderv.1.0.9
6. Start the world and turn it off
7. Paste the contents of CHUNKPASTE in the config (Files --> Plugins) for Chunkloader and paste the contents of GUARDPASTE in the config for WorldGuard

Sorry you have to do all this, it is a bit finnicky with Aternos.
